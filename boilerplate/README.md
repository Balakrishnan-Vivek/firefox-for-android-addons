boilerplate
==========

Here is some boilerplate code to help you jump-start your Firefox for Android add-on.

* `hub-boilerplate` provides a template for building an add-on that adds a new panel to the user's home page (a.k.a. a "Firefox Hub" add-on).
* `native-ui-boilerplate` provides a template for an add-on that modifies the native UI of Firefox for Android.

Refer to the [Firefox for Android Add-ons documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Firefox_for_Android) on MDN for tutorials and API reference.
